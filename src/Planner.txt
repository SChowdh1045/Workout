What time I woke up

Did I do the day's workout? (If NOT, explain why)

Did I bike outside?

What did I eat during the day?

What time am I filling out this form? (Should be before sleeping)

let logTracker = {
    August_31_2023: {
        wakeUp_Hr: "",
        wakeUp_Min: "",
        wakeup_am_pm: "",
        workout: "",
        foods: "",
        sleep_Hr: "",
        sleep_Min: "",
        sleep_am_pm: ""
    },

        wakeUp_Min: "",
        wakeup_am_pm: "",
        workout: "",
        foods: "",
